# Apriori-eclat-basket-analysis
apriori and eclat implementation form scratch
## very important :
dataset path should be changed based on where you put it.
pickle files have to be in the same place as your notebook
don't forget to termnitate matplotlib interaction 
apriori is much slower than eclat, but on the other hand,
eclat uses too much memory
## there is plenty of more information in the notebook files
