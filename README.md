# Apriori-eclat-basket-analysis
apriori and eclat implementation form scratch
## very important :
dataset path should be changed based on where you put it.<br/>
pickle files have to be in the same place as your notebook<br/>
don't forget to termnitate matplotlib interaction <br/>
apriori is much slower than eclat, but on the other hand,
eclat uses too much memory<br/>
## there is plenty of more information in the notebook files
